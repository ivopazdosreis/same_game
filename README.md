# same_game
University project written in Java. Challenge the AI for the highest score!

This game was developed for the AI module of my master’s degree. It is a Bubble Breaker style game, where the objective is to get the highest score by popping as many bubbles as possible, preferably if they are adjacent to other bubbles of the same colour. 
AI techniques such as breath first search and depth first search coupled with heuristics were used to solve the game. It is possible to “challenge the AI”, which will display a message with the number of moves and highest score the AI achieved for the current game board, and then ask the player to try and beat that score.

Rules:
- Get more points by popping lots of connected bubbles of the same colour
- Double your points by clearing the screen

How to Play:
-	Select AI difficulty level ‘Nível’>[choose difficulty]
-	Challenge the AI by selecting ‘Jogo > Desafiar’, then try to beat the AI’s highest score!

Options Menu (‘Jogo > Opções’):
-	Change the number of rows and columns of the game board
-	Change the number of different colours in the game (min 2, max 6)
